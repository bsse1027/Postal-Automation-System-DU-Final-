# Postal-Automation-System-DU-Final-
Final Repository of "Postal Automation System" which is intended to automate the process of Letter Sending Department,Room 306,Registrar Building,University Of Dhaka. <br>
The project is officially live now on: http://letter.du.ac.bd/ .
N.B : Don't get confused seeing the footer, someone else changed the footer after deployment. We, two third year student, while being just new to web development, prepared this project as our academic course but the bigger picture was to release this so that alma mater can get benefitted. When, the exam controller office, took the ownership of this, after we have deployed that on university server, one Asst. Programmer was appointed named "Sharmista Kuri" for after maintenance. She changed the footer to make it look it was developed by her. Although she took over the maintenace task after the full fledged web app was delivered. For proof, in this repo, you would find all the source code, the proposal document, SRS document, (in the Document folder here) we did while we were in the requirement phase. I wish her she will achieve great things in life, but it's still unknown why she snatched credit of some undergrad's work.<br>
